<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Henry, and I am an excellent ready-to-work Web/App Developer.</p>

<p>In my current role as a self-taught developer, I have demonstrated my commitment
  and proficiency by independently spearheading the development of an ecommerce
  app.
  This project not only serves as a testament to my technical abilities in Flutter and
  Dart but also showcases my determination, adaptability, and quick learning in a
  fast-paced environment.</p>

<p>What sets me apart is not only my technical skills but also the soft skills acquired
  throughout my varied career. From my time in the Airforce, I developed discipline
  and attention to detail. As a social worker, I honed my teamwork and
  communication skills, working seamlessly in multi-disciplinary teams. My
  experience as a mental health practitioner has instilled in me strong organisational
  functions, time management, and punctuality.</p>

<p>I am confident that my never-give-up and can-do attitude, coupled with my ability
to learn swiftly, would make a valuable contribution to your team at Morgan
Consulting. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my fresh perspective,
untouchable levels of enthusiasm, and a passion for creating innovative solutions
to your team.</p>
